# Getting Started with Action

Welcome to **Action** – a time-tracking and project visualization app that helps you understand how you spend your attention and energy.

## 📱 The Three Views

Action has three main tabs to help you track and visualize your time:

### 1. 📅 Calendar
**Track your daily activities in real-time**

- **Edit Anytime**: Drag the progress slider in the event modal to adjust duration or percentage

**Quick Tips:**

### 2. 📊 Analytics
**See patterns in how you spend your time**

- **Switch Time Views**: Toggle between Week, Month, and Year views

- Hovering shows exact time spent per project

### 3. 🎯 Visualization
**Explore your projects as interactive clusters**

- **Gravity-Based Layout**: Projects are pulled toward category clusters
